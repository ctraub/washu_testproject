#### Welcome to the WashU Test Project

Exercise for Group: 

This will incorporate a lot of the skills we have learned and will also require us to work as a team

Steps: 

Include Ian's text file (gis310sp14im)

1. Find a Teammate to work with. 

2. Fork the WashU Test Project. 

3. In your fork:
      - Checkout a branch to make edits/do work (remember to never edit/make changes in your fork's master)
      - Add a line to the Readme that says "Includes <insertnamehere>'s text file"
      - Create the text file in your fork

4. Add the WashU Test Project as an Upstream to keep work in sync. Also, make sure your fork is the remote (hint: when you clone the project down to your workspace from Github...what happens?).

5. Push your edits from step 3 above to your Fork on Github. 

5. Once you have made the edits and they are on your Fork on Github, make a pull request to WashU_Test Project that asks for your work to be added

6. Keep your work on your local machine and on your fork in sync with the WashU Test Project
